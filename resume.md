## INTODUCTION

This is not going to be a typical bullet style resume.  Often, a resume does not provide an opportunity for reflection.  My intention here is to have a place where I (or future employers) can ruminate upon my professional journey. 

*This is a not yet a complete professional journey.  More sections will be added as time permits*


## JOURNEY

### INFOMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY OFFICER

📅 2017-2018

💭Lesson Learned

As this was my first job towards the cyber security path, I was eager to learn all there was about security.  Unfortunately, this job turned to out to be less technical that I would hope for.  However, there were still many lessons that I learned along the way.  

One of them being the paramount of process and procedures.  Although often overlooked, this is a critical piece in any organization.   But not only it is important to have these in place, these need to be followed.   

🥇Greatest Accomplishment

Automated many process and procedures of my daily task.  This was done by a using a combination of VS Code and Microsoft Access.  By any measure in today's standard, it was a laughable attempt to code.  Still, it was a special moment as it was my first time making something to improve a process. 

🎯Skills Gained

- Workflow Optimization
- Risk Management
- Procedure Creations
### CLINICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR

📅2013-2017

💭Lesson Learned

This was my first job in the Information Technology realm so there were numerous lessons that I learned. The most impactful though was my realization of the value of customer service.  Being able to relate and communicate efficiently is of great importance.  If you are not able to, it is a frustrating experience for both parties. 

Though my definition of a customer has changed over time, this lesson is still of great relevance today.


🥇Greatest Accomplishment

Created a Role Based system for account access, an effort that span many months. In talking to many different clinics and departments, I was able to create 50 different roles.  This replaced the archaic mirror based access system that we had.  Even before I had any Cyber experience, I knew that this type of system had to go.
