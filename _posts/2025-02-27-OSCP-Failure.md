Sometimes failures are the best lessons

## INTRODUCTION

> "There's no such thing as a painless lesson; they just don't exist. Sacrifices are necessary. You can't gain anything without losing something first. Although… if you can endure that pain and walk away from it, you'll find that you now have a heart strong enough to overcome any obstacle. Yeah… a heart made full metal." – Edward Elric

It's often harder for us humans to admit failure than success. I am no different. So this blog will probably be harder for me to write than the others because I will be admitting a failure.

Of course, this isn't a philosophically focused blog, but I strongly feel that the best lessons in life are learned through pain.

And for me, failure is painful; however, failure is not the end of my journey—it’s only a detour.

Without further ado, let's get into it.

## **THE WHAT**

I failed my OSCP exam. Well, that was hard to say. Let me first talk about the days leading up to the exam.

### **⬅️ Before**

I spent about 8 months studying for it, went through the content, and actually got 30 proofs on the challenge labs! (Proofs mean that you have gained system/root-level access on a box.)

I also spent a majority of my time trying to hone my note-taking process and information flow. In the past, I often went way too fast when doing CTFs. My process helped me slow down and capture information before moving on. I'll be happy to share this as well!

### **🎯 Test Day**

Obviously, I can't talk too much about the exam itself. If you are unaware, the OSCP is a 24-hour test 🤯.

This was the first 24-hour exam I had taken, so I was unsure how to pace myself or how I would feel.

Filled with excitement and eagerness, I started the exam around 10 a.m. Things were going pretty well, and I made some decent progress. I got some flags and a few of the boxes. But then, I got stuck—really hard.

This "wall" proved to be my downfall, as I was unable to move past it and ultimately lost the exam.

### **💭 Post Exam**

Here are some thoughts I have gathered from my experience:

- ⌛ **24 Hours:** 24 hours is a long time to be constantly engaged. Although I did take breaks, I should have taken them more frequently.
- 🗄️ **Active Directory:** My AD skills need more tuning.
- 👀 **Attention to Detail:** After reviewing my notes, I figured out what I needed to move on. If I had paid more attention, I think I would have realized the move I needed to make.

## **THE FUTURE**

> _"Sometimes, it's not about the victories we notch; it's about having the courage to fight on—even after every setback."_ – Commander Shepard

I try not to let it bring me down too much, even though it hurts. Instead of keeping my head down, I'm taking steps to improve my skills. Here’s how:

### 🏫 **Study**

I'm doubling down on my efforts to study the art of red teaming. I've also signed up for additional courses outside of OffSec to further hone my skills.

### 🗻 **Capture the Flags**

I'm challenging myself to complete more Active Directory CTFs for additional hands-on experience.

### 🧑‍🏫 **Teaching**

They say you learn more when you teach. I plan to create an Active Directory class to deepen my understanding of the content.

### 📖 **Reading**

Reading is another great way to learn. I plan to dive into books focused on Active Directory.

Not all plans need to have 15 points. I wanted to keep it simple yet attainable.

Hope it goes well, and I can write a blog titled, **"I Passed the OSCP!"**

**P.S.** I'm all about sharing knowledge. To that end, I will be updating this blog with a link to my notes and templates! **Stay tuned.**
